# Data Analysis RBAC Agent

AI-powered **data analysis agent** with **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** hosted on **AWS**.  
This is a **monorepo** containing both the backend and frontend of the application, built with **Next.js**.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and designed to be fun and easy to get your hands dirty with the **AI SDK**.

### Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the frontend by modifying app/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit.

This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

📊 Dataset Requirements (Retail Sector)
These requirements are for selecting retail datasets to power the data analysis agent.

Requirements
Multi-table (e.g., sales, inventory, products, customers, stores, optionally employees/promotions)

Realistic, with order-level detail, product/category/customer/store info, and time/date fields

In CSV (preferred) or other easy-to-import formats for Postgres/SQL

Large enough — thousands of records, multiple years if possible

Well-documented with basic table and column descriptions
